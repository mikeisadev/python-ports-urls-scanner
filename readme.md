# Local and Network Ports Scanner
This is a python desktop program written with TKinter and CustomTKInter to recreate a simple local PC ports scanner (USB, Bluetooth, WiFi and LAN ports, next the scan for Jack ports will be implemented)

This tool also includes a simple scanner for external IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6) or complete hostnames (for example: google.com, facebook.com etc.).

A small tool is included to get PC info on the toolbar of the header of the program.
